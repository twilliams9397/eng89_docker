# Creating microservice
- when creating images/containerising from clients app/files etc, need to know:
- any dependencies
- what ports will be needed/allowed
- what os will be used
- what engine will be used
- has the app been tested, and on what platform
- is it using a database, and which if so
- we make no changes to app given to us, but report any bugs found
- investigate contents of app and all folders, if it doesn't make sense ask
- get enough info to start deployment
